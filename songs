These are some favorites of mine.

Walkman - Kasso (Kasso produced some extremely listenable instrumental disco pop songs during the late 70's and early 80's. This one gets really funky towards the end)

Take a Chance - Mr. Flagio

We're On Our Way Home - Brainstorm

Flowers in the Rain - Thai Break

Ma Quale Idea - Pino D'angiò

Hypnotic Tango - My Mine (This one has some delightful 80's New Wave influences. Just wait until they get to the chorus.)
